Magnetic Poetry
---------------
## Concepts covered
* reading data in from a file
* object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript
* collision detection
* using typography functions
* events
* thoughts for how to extend this

## What will be produced
At the very least, a program that works like a magnetic poetry board.

This session will hopefully live in the space where determination, programming, CS, creative coding, and literal poetry overlap. Starting from a list of words and a dream, we will develop a magnetic poetry program, learning CS, p5, life lessons, and poetic licensure along the way. There may also be a smidgeon of math.
